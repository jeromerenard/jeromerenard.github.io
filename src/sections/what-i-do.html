            <h3>Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                When working as an engineer, my approach is to make the raw recorded track sound as good as the artist idea and vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Engineering is also fixing all kind of things and problems, setting up a session, a live or even a full studio.
